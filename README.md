# Cafe-website
This café website project showcases a vibrant and user-friendly design, highlighting the café's menu, ambiance, and community events. I focused on responsive layouts and seamless navigation to enhance user experience. The site features an online ordering system, integrated social media, and a blog to engage customers and promote local culture.
